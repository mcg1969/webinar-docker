A simple Dockerfile and accompanying files to demonstrate running conda
inside of a Docker container. Assumes the ability to connect to repo.anaconda.com.
Modify `environment.txt` to change the contents of the conda environment.

This is purely for demo purposes. I make no claims of correctness or even
the best approach for all challenges considered. That said, please feel
free to use or modify for your own applications; no attribution required.
